1. Todo Stuff
    - Figure out how to make a Todo selectable with an active-todo class
    - When active, remove active-todo class from all other Todos
    - When active, change the task-container display to show only the active Todo's tasks

2. Task Stuff
    - Add functionality to renderTasks() in dom.js
        - Add an addTaskBtn in html to add tasks to the currently active todo's tasks
        - forEach task in a todo, create an li input checkbox that is stored in a ul
        - Connect the checkbox value to the this.status of the corresponding task
        - Add edit task btn to each task
        - Add delete task btn to each task
        - If all checkboxes in a are "Checked" then todo.status = Complete
        - Make a task selectable with an active-task class
        - When active, remove active-task class from all other tasks
        - When active, change the info-container display to show only the active tasks
    - Use date picker when creating a new task for this.dueDate turn it into a readable date with date-fns

3. Info Stuff
    - Figure out if a class is best suited for info or if a module is even needed. Maybe dom only?
        - Since the info is only displayed maybe it does't need a module or class
    - Add renderInfo() function in dom.js to render a selected tasks info to #info-container
        - Add a notes textbox that updates when typing for this.notes
        - Clone the current tasks edit & delete btn's and add to info display

4. Storage Stuff
    - No idea yet, leave that for later.

5. Styles Stuff
    - I love styles
